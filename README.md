# GeneticAlgorithmCardsProblem
Genetic algorithm:
input: size N of set of cards 1 ...N (cards from 1 to N)<br/>
target: divide cards set to 2 sets that first one sums to S and second one product is I.<br/>
For examplem: SIZE = 10, cards = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}<br/>
A = {3, 7, 8, 9, 10} sum = 37<br/>
B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6} product = 240<br>
looking for best cards sets that satisfies sum and product.<br/>
