# GeneticAlgorithmCardsProblem
Genetic algorithm:
input: size N of set of cards 1 ...N (cards from 1 to N)
target: divide cards set to 2 sets that first one sums to S and second one product is I.
For examplem: SIZE = 10, cards = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
A = {3, 7, 8, 9, 10} sum = 37
B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6} product = 240
looking for best cards sets taht satisfies sum and product.
